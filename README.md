## Version
00.00.001.001
## Description:
Binary Toolkit bases for HexMonitoriks a cross-platform (Windows,Linux,Android,MacOs,iOS) control monitor for a antimalware security cluster conglomerated distributed heterogeneous network agency.

### Binary Reader
Reads any file and ouput to file its binary (octal,hex,ascii,utf-8,utf-16,utf-32,cct: custom code table) dump. Tries to output the format and the metadata of the file.

### Binary Ops
A binary toolkit for cybersecurity operations. Uses Psideralis Math Utitilities and licensed commercial privative Psideralis code, as well as a command with basic functions: xorgdiff, xorgcntrl, xfsdiff, xfscntrl, xprocdiff, xproccntrl, xnetdiff, xnetcntrl, binop, binyect, bintrace.

#### Netcryptocompress
Cryptographic and compression network server for binary ops, bases for XenoEngine: a zero knowledge enclosed runtime cryptoengine. Uses Psideralis Math Utitilities and licensed commercial privative Psideralis code.

### Binary Pit
A CLI (command line interface) monitor tool with binary reader and operations capabilities for antimalware security cluster conglomerated distributed heterogeneous network agency administration.

## HexMonitoriks

For full results (HexMonitoriks: GUI for Supressor, a thread based operator, with integrated XenoEngine, a zero knowledge enclosed runtime cryptoengine) with world map real time display for network administration of cluster conglomerated distributed heterogeneous network agency systems and graphical representations for data visualization, machine learning security predictions, prefactums, postdictions and postfactums (offensive-active, affensive-dilative, evasive-omisive and defensive-pasive) in seven levels of security and multiple features more (including custom cryptography, stenography with media and real time transactions monitoring with non-repudiatable authorizations), all included in commercial version.
