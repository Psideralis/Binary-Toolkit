VISITED THE WIKI FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT INSTALLATION, USE AND DERIVATES. A ZIP RELEASE IS DATED FOR THE END OF 2025.

## Description:
Binary Toolkit bases for HexMonitoriks a intercrossplatform (Windows,Linux,Android,MacOs,iOS) control monitor for a security clustered conglomerated distributed heterogeneous network agency.

## Dependencies:
    PSI_ProgrammingUtilities
    Psideralis++ Standard Library 

### Binary Reader
Reads any file and ouput to file its binary (octal,hex,ascii,utf-8,utf-16,utf-32,cct: custom code table) dump. Tries to output the format and the metadata of the file. Includes dissasembler, decompiler and deinterpreter (Pendant).

### Binary Ops
A binary toolkit for cybersecurity operations. Uses Psideralis Math Utitilities and licensed commercial privative Psideralis code, as well as a command with basic functions: xorgdiff, xorgcntrl, xfsdiff, xfscntrl, xprocdiff, xproccntrl, xmoddiff, xmodcntrl xnetdiff, xnetcntrl, binop, binyect, bintrace.

#### Netcryptocompress
Cryptographic and compression network server for binary ops, bases for ZER0Engine: a zero knowledge, auditable transparents and ZER0 encrypted cryptoengine and archive crypt. Uses Psideralis Math Utitilities and licensed commercial privative Psideralis code.

### Binary Pit
A CLI (command line interface) monitor multiple server layers-client tool with binary reader and operations capabilities for antimalware security cluster conglomerated distributed heterogeneous network agency administration.

    - Security: Antimalware, antivirus, digital protection and credentials provider.
    - Cluster: Multiple servers layers - multiple clients.
    - Conglomerated: Distributed, parallel, concurrent.
    - Heterogeneous: Intercrossplatform administration (Windows, Linux, Android, MacOS, iOS).
    - Network: TCP-IP/Psideralis Communication Protocols.
    - Agency: Control and administration ops.


## HexMonitoriks

For full results (HexMonitoriks: GUI for BinaryToolkit integrated ZER0Engine and Supressor: a exploit database) with world map real time display and graphical representations for data visualization, machine learning security predictions and prescriptions (offensive-active, affensive-dilative, evasive-omisive and defensive-pasive) in multiple layers of security and a lot of features more (including custom cryptography, stenography with media and real time transactions monitoring with non-repudiatable authorization) contact Psideralis for subscriptin of a commercial version and cybersecurity services.
