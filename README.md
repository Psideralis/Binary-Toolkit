## Description:
Binary Toolkit bases for Supressor a cross-platform (Windows,Linux,Android,MacOs,iOS) and cross-architecture (x84, amd64, ARM, MIPS, POWER, RISC-V) control monitor for a antimalware security cluster conglomerated distributed heterogeneous network agency.

### Binary Reader
Reads any file and ouput to file its binary (octal,hex,ascii,utf-8,utf-16,utf-32,cct: custom code table) dump. Tries to output the format and the metadata of the file.

### Binary Ops
A binary toolkit for cybersecurity operations. Includes partially open development headers and object libraries, as well as a command with basic functions: xorgdiff, xorgcntrl, xfsdiff, xfscntrl, xprocdiff, xproccntrl, xnetdiff, xnetcntrl, binop, binyect, bintrace.

#### Netcryptocompress
Cryptographic and compression network server for binary ops, bases for XenoEngine: a zero knowledge enclosed cryptoengine. Uses Psideralis Math Utitilities and licensed commercial privative Psideralis code.

### Binary Pit
A CLI (command line interface) monitor tool with binary reader and operations capabilities for antimalware security cluster conglomerated distributed heterogeneous network agency administration.

For full results (HexMonitoriks: GUI for Supressor with integrated XenoEngine) with world map real time display for network administration of cluster conglomerated distributed heterogeneous systems and graphical representations for data visualization, machine learning security predictions, prefactums, postdictions and postfactums (offensive, affensive, evasive and defensive) in seven levels of security and multiple features more (including custom cryptography, stenography with real time transactions monitoring and zero knowledge non-repudiatable certificated operations), all included in commercial version.
